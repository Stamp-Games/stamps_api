#Mission Statement:  
To provide a way to educate young people of various ages about the world of stamps through an interactive digital experience. 

#Project Overview: 
We will build web based games/ interactive media to support the education goals of the convention, and provide a collection point for those projects to be easily sought out by users. This collection point/ landing page will also contain links to 3rd party interactive media, as well as links to learn more about the process/ hobby/ postal system. As part of the project, we will be developing an open source API that will resolve to be a digital source for stamp factoids and images, so the developers of the media donâ€™t have to source their own content.
